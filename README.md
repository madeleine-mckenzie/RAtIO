Mg isotope optimisation code

Determining Mg isotope ratios unfortunately requires some level of spectroscopic intuition about whether a model is a good fit to the data. My code can not be run without a very very careful analysis and every single line must be checked by eye.

Thus, I have decided that if you would like to determine Mg isotopes, please contact me and we can collaborate on the project together. Until there are robust failsafes in place that will catch these poor fits, I am too concerned that people may misuse the code and publish incorrect isotopic ratios. 

I'm sorry!!
